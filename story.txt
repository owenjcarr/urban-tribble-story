Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Each pig built there own house to live in. One little piggy built a straw house, one little piggy built a wood house, and one little piggy built a brick house.
These houses were unique, however, as the three little pigs lived at UW Madison. Each of these houses were frat houses and were notorious for their parties. However, one day, this all changed when one big blow would change the semester forever.
Coronavirus hit America, and each of the little pigs were forced to clear their houses and head home. The houses that they built with their own hands were now empty and a place once buzzing with activity had become a deserted building.
The pigs finished their semester at home in sadness, dreaming of what could have been if the virus didn't strike.
