Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Each pig built there own house to live in. One little piggy built a straw house, one little piggy built a wood house, and one little piggy built a brick house.
These houses were unique, however, as the three little pigs lived at UW Madison. Each of these houses were frat houses and were notorious for their parties. However, one day, this all changed when one big blow would change the semester forever.
